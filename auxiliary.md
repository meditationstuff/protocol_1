If you find you can’t do something, explore how to phrase it conditionally:

(You might ask, why can’t I do this? How can I come to be able to do this? How did I come to not be able to do this? How do I know I can’t do this?)

can’t X since Y  
can’t X where Y  
can’t X because Y  
can’t X without Y  
etc.  

Then, if it might be good to able to do X even while the conditions obtains, you might ask something like:

How might I be able to do X even while Y? What are some worlds where I might be able to do X even while Y?  even when Y? even if it’s not Y yet? even if Y has since obtained? even if Y holds? even if Y? even without Y?

Or, if it might be good to not have the condition obtain so you can do X, you might ask something like:

If Y prevents: How might I not have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y doesn’t obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?

If Y enables: How might I have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y does obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?

comment:

This one needs refinement of scope and clarity, and also careful consideration of safety in the most literal ways. For me comes from climbing, hiking, alpinism: "Exert yourself past a few layers of muscular and cardiovascular exhaustion, but not so many that you have to stop, to achieve a difficult goal." I'm pointing at something that feels qualitatively different to me than HIIT-type pushing to failure. It seems important that there is a summit or whatever to get to (and come back from!) and what you are doing is ultimately unsustainable but will last you just the next hour/day/relevant medium term, and somehow you are doing a bunch of inference to figure out just how hard that means pushing yourself right now.

comment:

For me & probably others, there is residue from the way I was taught to meditate, namely from instructions like “if you notice you’re thinking, return to the breath” or similar. There are some very tight hooks in my mind such that when I notice certain things, I immediately have some internal reaction. There are lots of them, but one which is probably pretty common for people who’ve tried pop meditation is: notice thought -> interrupt it & pay attention to something else.

comment:

People do things completely outside our expectations, sometimes outside our expectations of anyone, anywhere doing such a thing or being such a way. A natural response is potentially the emotions above. They might be more extreme or last longer and more repetatively than you thought possible or good. But allowing those emotions, when there’s enough wisdom/slack/space in the system, when it’s safe to allow those emotions, facilitates processing, model building, wisdom. On the other side of those emotions is wisdom--sometimes it’s forgiveness, sometimes it’s forbearance, sometimes it’s surgical competence, sometimes it’s love, and many other things. Can’t predict the specific shape of wisdom (I think; though it can be healthy/smart/good to try). (edited)

There are lots of ways i can know something, like knowing something consciously (i.e. thinking about it), knowing something implicitly like a word in a language that i don’t know consciously but know implicitly, or knowing something unconsciously like how i can know that i know how to type without actually being able to recall any of the details of how i learned how to type.

comment:

Be careful not to inappropriately reify primary and secondary attention, awareness, etc.. Secondary attention can be analogous to peripheral vision. If one stably foviates on an object one can stably track things in peripheral vision. Similarly, if one somewhat stably maintains primary attention on something (or looks "through" a primary object, as per e.g. Culadasa, one can explore and track things in secondary attention (Culdasa's "awareness").

Offer 1% of that, do the first millimeter or less, and completely experience that first millimeter.  Notice how it feels and what if anything happens to the desire to do that particular thing.

comment:

Don’t overdo it: if doing so activated your system then only a little into it before resting. This is something like opening the “Print Queue” of actions that got added to the queue and were not carried out, either because they were inhibited or didn’t fire in time because something was happening too fast, or something came up before they could find their natural completion.  There is a happy percentage (e.g. 1%) that might allow the print queue to clear out, without triggering whatever inhibitted the action in the first place and made it “stuck”.

comment:

A:

this has been v valuable to me. or rather, the way i initially interpreted it, which is instead of dismissing self-mistrust when it arises, validating/legitimizing it by exploring the reasons the mistrust actually "has a point" so to speak

B:

Yes! That's very much the intention for it
I've been developing a whole framework based on this shift from dismissing to validating, and would love to hear as much as you want to share about your experiences with it
Vital to actually building self-trust
And applies on all scales, eg to other people, as well

A:

Yes! Totally. There’s an important tension here around “trusting our mistrust”

You can communicate "telepathically" with other "parts" of yourself. And they can do the same, to you and to each other. https://twitter.com/meditationstuff/status/1360398764301811713

Maybe, gently: Try to temporarily treat other parts of you as "completely drained of \*your\* volition." Disclaimed (and eventually reclaimed) volitionality.

(Compare with Ingram’s analogy: touch the surface of the [not necessarily still water], maintain contact with that surface; without letting the back of the hand get wet.)

Try to get on the problematic thing’s side, in (maybe slight) part, as much as you can and is safe. This can on net make the bodymind “more whole,” and free up more slack, in a way that allows the problematic thing to become less problematic, on its own terms while self-respecting its own needs, in a way that is immediately or long-run better, but or integrative, for the whole.

Enhance it, facilitate it, cause it, invoke it, provoke it, turn towards it.

comment:

Even if there's a dash of forciness, or tiny bit of out-of-order-ness, sometimes, maybe one of the last things you reach for, is directly causing the bad thing. This is in part because we can get in a rut, can be entrenching the avoiding some bad thing, and trying to directly (or semi-directly, or indirectly) cause the bad thing can illuminate entrenched and/&#8203;or active "avoidance" that's preventing integration, burn-off--redo-to-undo. Probably previously, the avoiding, protecting, turning away was adaptive, necessary, that's the only option you had. But maybe you kept layering, entrenching, momentum-ing on top of that, even when it was good enough. And then, when it became safe to actually go into the thing, it is/&#8203;was/&#8203;will be necessary to work through all that layering that ended up on top. And sometimes, right near the end of that, to help you find the last of that layering, trying to somehow directly invoke the bad thing (remember it, cause it [e.g. muscle tension]) can be helpful.

I was cautious about adding this because these sorts of questions can problematically reify directionality and "space itself".

Pick simple movement (repeatable or circular/&#8203;"perfect-loop-able", isolated or full-body); or a posture; or line/paragraph to speak.

And then, pick one or some qualities you want (it) to embody (e.g. elegant, economical, graceful, beautiful, poised, relaxed, effortless…).

And then explore/&#8203;experiment with doing/&#8203;holding/&#8203;being/&#8203;saying it (the movement/&#8203;posture/&#8203;speech) with that quality, or (gently, indirectly) incline towards that quality or better versions of that quality.

Later, instead of a specific quality or qualities, try exploring it (the moment/&#8203;posture/&#8203;speech) (with) just (indirectly, gently) inclinig generally towards “improving”/&#8203;/&#8203;"improvement"/&#8203;“better” (on your terms, wordlessly or perhaps in your own (implicit or explicit) words.

comment:

\* The movements, postures, speaking above should be a physical movements, "external postures," or out-loud speech---not a “mental action”, nor an “attentional/awareness action” (solely), nor “thought speech” nor maybe whispered speech. These have subtle pitfalls, so it's maybe better to let these be transformed, through and through, by other practices in the whole, wider document.

Ask, for maybe doing X, if not now, when? If the answer is "never," this could indicate an ordering error or possibly an expectation that X is conceptually confused or will spontaneously be addressed, and so on.

messy comment from original notes:

look for not yet and make sure that the answer to when? isn't never
sometimes turns out the thing dissolves and so when/never don't make sense. but other times this points to an ordering error if it's sort of a thing that one should sort of do eventually. if not never that doesn't necessarily mean "now" of course. maybe some other time. but if the never dissolves before that times comes, in that world where the thing is a thing, then that's probably net good.

Say, for example, when you're in a quiet room by yourself. Now you're in the room instead of "elsewhere" or "elsewhen." (stated maybe another way, of many ways, in a way, say, where, perhaps, something like "the reality or captivation of the inner world" sort of temporarily recedes)

(gently, let it slip when it wants to slip)

(nothing particular is otherwise required of attention, awareness, etc.)

alternatives: let your self be here, now. encourage yourself to be here, now. help yourself feel safe being here, now. ...

Consider or pretend or entertain that you *have* to be anxious about *something*, that you *must* be anxious about *something*, that *surely* you're anxious about *something*. Now---what perhaps might that or those something(s) be??? As one option, it's ok to just guess and see what comes up.

comment:

You can do this for things that seem "purely physical," too---e.g., pretend that this sharp, burning pain you feel in the left side of your chest (that, say, even, was so bad you got it checked out by a doctor but they couldn't find anything by sight, palpation, labs, or imaging), that, gently, provisionally, just for the sake of exploration and experimentation, *has* to be anxiety-related, *must* be anxiety-related, *surely* is somehow anxiety-related. Now---what perhaps might that or those something(s) be??? As one option, it's ok to just guess and see what comes up.

# <span id="940auxiliary"></span><a id="redirect-attention" href="#redirect-attention">redirect attention:</a>

Deliberately redirect your attention, (away) from something that is tugging on, or would like to hold onto attention, to something else.

comment:

You might momentarily or briefly sustain this redirection of attention or simply let go afterwards and see what happens.

You might explore "reversibility," whether such redirection "does something" that can be "one-step undone." It's not necessarily a bad thing if not or if "it doesn't seem to work that way."

Redirecting attention could be "doing something else;" it's not limited to just/&#8203;only "attending to something else."

The/&#8203;which particular "something else" or "(doing) something else" in any particular relevant (pre-)moment might matter more, sometimes, and matter less, sometimes.

Add something that pulls attention to the environment, e.g. music, an open window, streaming video, netflix, an audiobook, a lightshow on the ceiling, etc.

comment:

This doesn't mean you should actively avoid the attentionally pulling thing, or that you should or shouldn't get lost in it or that you should or shouldn't enjoy it, or that you should or shouldn't "deconstruct" it, or anything, etc.

Consider or pretend or entertain that perhaps it *must* be the case, that it's *surely* the case, that there's *something* bad, or something bad happened, or somehow, somewhere you feel bad or awful or etc. about something that *did* happen, or *is* happening, or could happen, or might happen, or will happen, or may have happened, or is still happening, or will start to happen, or will cause bad things to happen, or can't be prevented, or will inevitably happen, as best you can tell, or feels terrible, or awful, or intolerable, or terrifying, or horrifying, or existentially despairing, in any case, as best you can tell. Now, gently, gently, gently, patiently, for short stints, with lots of breaks, over time, explore where, how, what, why, when, whither that might be.

comment:

Try to request not demand. Might have to actually engage with it, fear of actually engaging with out-of-control-ness or something that might not listen or something for which asking might be a type error, or fear that it might say no initially or perpetually, or might not be "reasonable-enough," in some sense, or it can't or won't or doesn't (yet) know how (you can try to help it figure out how), or it won't be understand or care about why you want it to stop, or it won't know how to win-win synergize and negotiate across a longer time horizon (you can try to teach it; you can try asking what it wants and needs). And of course sometimes it's better to eat more protein or take a vitamin or something than to try to negotiate out of something downstream of a nutrient deficiency or that you are a little dehydrated or etc., etc., etc.

Transcript shared with persmission:

"I guess suffering is really important to me. It let's me know that I'm alive. It justifies my craziness to other people and makes me less embarrassed about myself. It makes me hate myself less. It creates a surface area to be loved. It's diffficult for me to know how to be loved otherwise. I'm not sure I know how to relate to people if I'm not suffering. I'm not sure I know what people expect from me if I'm not suffering. I was going to say something about hating myself or hating life or something but it's more like punishing myself, punishing other people, and punishing the world for me not getting what I want. I do want to be unique and special and suffering with respect to not getting what I want confirms that I'm unique and special—and misunderstood. I'm just so sad about the things... I'm not sure what to do with the sadness and grief. I feel like I was promised these things; I don't know by who or whom or how. I deserve to suffer. I hoped I was going to outrun suffering or something—cutting edge of everything; maybe would go different for me [no control but can make choices]. There's no point of I'm not sufferig. There's no meaning if I'm not suffering. It's not real if I'm not suffering. Way to justify my "bad behavior" to other people. s[sense of entitlement/narcissism — felt owed and angry/furious weren't delivered / outrage / so angry, mean, entitled, spoiled, do want to hurt people]"

more:

* suffering justifies my existence
* people won't know I'm suffering (hurting? need help?) if I don't (visibly?) suffer
* suffering is the texture of life
* suffering gives meaning
* suffering makes it so there's stakes
* suffering makes good things all worth it
* suffering makes good things better
* things that happened to me won't matter if there was no suffering; suffering marks their meaning

# <span id="952auxiliary"></span><a id="find-the-now" href="#find-the-now">quiet mind reveals the now:</a>

Look around for some way to "automatically" quiet the mind. This won't always work, depending on what's going on in your life, if you're particularly experiencing a strong emotion or anxiety (though often even then), or when you last ate, or what you last ate, and how long ago, and so on.

Find something to gently pay attention to, that's safe to pay attention to; Sometimes it's something outside of yourself, like sounds; sometimes it's a bodypart or something interoceptive. You want to find something that draws you in a little bit, that's here and now. You might find if you do this that the mind becomes quiet and you find yourself in space, in a room or outside, in the now, where sight and sounds are clearer and your body is peaceful, nothing to do, really.

It's something of a matter of finding the right thing to attend to or also the right "how," so it could be a "move" different than "attending." For some time, I found "making friends with my digestion" to be useful; my digestive system, and being friendly and helpful towards it, even if it didn't need it, was a nice place to rest for a few moments. And what "works" for you might change over time. As with anything, be careful with button-pushing. Treat this as an experiment and something to play with, not something to rely on but certainly something you can try when it seems like it'd be useful.

\*

You might find in this state that thoughts, thinking, mind arises *in* that spatiousness and quietness and experiential nowness, or somewhere *proximal*, and *adjacent elsewhereness*, almost with quasi-spatiality. [this line also elsewhere in document]
