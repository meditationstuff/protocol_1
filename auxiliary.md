can’t X where Y  
can’t X because Y  
can’t X without Y  
etc.  

Then, if it might be good to able to do X even while the conditions obtains, you might ask something like:

How might I be able to do X even while Y? What are some worlds where I might be able to do X even while Y?  even when Y? even if it’s not Y yet? even if Y has since obtained? even if Y holds? even if Y? even without Y?

Or, if it might be good to not have the condition obtain so you can do X, you might ask something like:

If Y prevents: How might I not have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y doesn’t obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?

If Y enables: How might I have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y does obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?

comment:

This one needs refinement of scope and clarity, and also careful consideration of safety in the most literal ways. For me comes from climbing, hiking, alpinism: "Exert yourself past a few layers of muscular and cardiovascular exhaustion, but not so many that you have to stop, to achieve a difficult goal." I'm pointing at something that feels qualitatively different to me than HIIT-type pushing to failure. It seems important that there is a summit or whatever to get to (and come back from!) and what you are doing is ultimately unsustainable but will last you just the next hour/day/relevant medium term, and somehow you are doing a bunch of inference to figure out just how hard that means pushing yourself right now.

comment:

For me & probably others, there is residue from the way I was taught to meditate, namely from instructions like “if you notice you’re thinking, return to the breath” or similar. There are some very tight hooks in my mind such that when I notice certain things, I immediately have some internal reaction. There are lots of them, but one which is probably pretty common for people who’ve tried pop meditation is: notice thought -> interrupt it & pay attention to something else.

Explore how to make it safe to feel (extreme, white hot, perseverative, repetitive) anger, rage, hate/hatred, outrage, disgust, fury (fear, envy, jealousy, horror) at specific/&#8203;particular/&#8203;concrete people in general or for specific/&#8203;particular/&#8203;concrete behaviors/&#8203;actions/&#8203;inactions/&#8203;commissions/&#8203;omissions, for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks. Deem them as horrible and bad as they are, to you or in the absolute. Explore how to make it safe to not suppress this, to not talk yourself out of this, to not try to (prematurely or otherwise) forgive them, to not try to (prematurely or otherwise) understand them or walk in their shoes so as to humanize, empathize, etc. (You can surely do all those things, but also explore the former things, too.

comment:

People do things completely outside our expectations, sometimes outside our expectations of anyone, anywhere doing such a thing or being such a way. A natural response is potentially the emotions above. They might be more extreme or last longer and more repetatively than you thought possible or good. But allowing those emotions, when there’s enough wisdom/slack/space in the system, when it’s safe to allow those emotions, facilitates processing, model building, wisdom. On the other side of those emotions is wisdom--sometimes it’s forgiveness, sometimes it’s forbearance, sometimes it’s surgical competence, sometimes it’s love, and many other things. Can’t predict the specific shape of wisdom (I think; though it can be healthy/smart/good to try). (edited)

There are lots of ways i can know something, like knowing something consciously (i.e. thinking about it), knowing something implicitly like a word in a language that i don’t know consciously but know implicitly, or knowing something unconsciously like how i can know that i know how to type without actually being able to recall any of the details of how i learned how to type.

comment:

Be careful not to inappropriately reify primary and secondary attention, awareness, etc.. Secondary attention can be analogous to peripheral vision. If one stably foviates on an object one can stably track things in peripheral vision. Similarly, if one somewhat stably maintains primary attention on something (or looks "through" a primary object, as per e.g. Culadasa, one can explore and track things in secondary attention (Culdasa's "awareness").

See whether something in the body wants something: e.g. to squeeze the legs together, to raise an arm protectively or in preparation to stab down.
Offer 1% of that, do the first millimeter or less, and completely experience that first millimeter.  Notice how it feels and what if anything happens to the desire to do that particular thing.

comment:

Don’t overdo it: if doing so activated your system then only a little into it before resting. This is something like opening the “Print Queue” of actions that got added to the queue and were not carried out, either because they were inhibited or didn’t fire in time because something was happening too fast, or something came up before they could find their natural completion.  There is a happy percentage (e.g. 1%) that might allow the print queue to clear out, without triggering whatever inhibitted the action in the first place and made it “stuck”.

comment:

A:

this has been v valuable to me. or rather, the way i initially interpreted it, which is instead of dismissing self-mistrust when it arises, validating/legitimizing it by exploring the reasons the mistrust actually "has a point" so to speak

B:

Yes! That's very much the intention for it
I've been developing a whole framework based on this shift from dismissing to validating, and would love to hear as much as you want to share about your experiences with it
Vital to actually building self-trust
And applies on all scales, eg to other people, as well

A:

Yes! Totally. There’s an important tension here around “trusting our mistrust”

You can communicate "telepathically" with other "parts" of yourself. And they can do the same, to you and to each other. https://twitter.com/meditationstuff/status/1360398764301811713

Maybe, gently: Try to temporarily treat other parts of you as "completely drained of \*your\* volition." Disclaimed (and eventually reclaimed) volitionality.

Do something (try to do something) or (try to) block/&#8203;prevent something from happening, or stop something that’s already happening, with the lightest and most minimal possible “touch,” “with a feather.”

comment:

You might say something like, ok, I could do X if I really made myself, or overrode myself, or with 10/10 effort. But how about 8/10 effort? (Explore or refactor around that, for a bit.) How about 6/10? … How about 3/10? … How about 1/10? ( = “with a feather”) … How about 0.01/10?

Keep something company, hang out with it, spend patient time with it, without trying to change it, without trying to enhance it, without trying to make it go away. You might “surf” with, lightly ride any undulations, waxing and waning, ebb and flow, while doing this. (Compare with Ingram’s analogy: touch the surface of the [not necessarily still water], maintain contact with that surface; without letting the back of the hand get wet.)

Try to get on the problematic thing’s side, in (maybe slight) part, as much as you can and is safe. This can on net make the bodymind “more whole,” and free up more slack, in a way that allows the problematic thing to become less problematic, on its own terms while self-respecting its own needs, in a way that is immediately or long-run better, but or integrative, for the whole. (Not to inappropriately reign any of these “things.”)

Enhance it, facilitate it, cause it, invoke it, provoke it, turn towards it.

comment:

Even if there's a dash of forciness, or tiny bit of out-of-order-ness, sometimes, maybe one of the last things you reach for, is directly causing the bad thing. This is in part because we can get in a rut, can be entrenching the avoiding some bad thing, and trying to directly (or semi-directly, or indirectly) cause the bad thing can illuminate entrenched and/&#8203;or active "avoidance" that's preventing integration, burn-off--redo-to-undo. Probably previously, the avoiding, protecting, turning away was adaptive, necessary, that's the only option you had. But maybe you kept layering, entrenching, momentum-ing on top of that, even when it was good enough. And then, when it became safe to actually go into the thing, it is/&#8203;was/&#8203;will be necessary to work through all that layering that ended up on top. And sometimes, right near the end of that, to help you find the last of that layering, trying to somehow directly invoke the bad thing (remember it, cause it [e.g. muscle tension]) can be helpful.

comment:

I was cautious about adding this because these sorts of questions can problematically reify directionality and "space itself". But many people do find locational/&#8203;spatial prompts very useful, and for many people they'll be very helpful for redo-to-undo prompting (which can happen without such prompting too).

Ask, when is it? Try to anticipate it and catch it in the act. Try to do that minimally, without any "pre actions," see if you can smoothly, spontaneously rise to meet it (with minimal attention or i.e. mere/&#8203;bare/&#8203;luminous awareness) exactly as it happens, luminously, without armature or artifice.

comment:

And again and again, in same. This will eventually come from some place spontaneous, automatic, done-for-you, more riding a bike than planning the rocks you'll step on to cross a stream, and/&#8203;but the bike is more like a laser pointer flicking around but also the laser pointer spot is liquid and continuous with everything, or something. This may never be particularly salient and may feel like something different to you or like nothing at all. Potentially misleading.

Pick simple movement (repeatable or circular/&#8203;"perfect-loop-able", isolated or full-body); or a posture; or line/paragraph to speak.

And then, pick one or some qualities you want (it) to embody (e.g. elegant, economical, graceful, beautiful, poised, relaxed, effortless…).

And then explore/&#8203;experiment with doing/&#8203;holding/&#8203;being/&#8203;saying it (the movement/&#8203;posture/&#8203;speech) with that quality, or (gently, indirectly) incline towards that quality or better versions of that quality.

Later, instead of a specific quality or qualities, try exploring it (the moment/&#8203;posture/&#8203;speech) (with) just (indirectly, gently) inclinig generally towards “improving”/&#8203;/&#8203;"improvement"/&#8203;“better” (on your terms, wordlessly or perhaps in your own (implicit or explicit) words.

comment:

\* The movements, postures, speaking above should be a physical movements, "external postures," or out-loud speech---not a “mental action”, nor an “attentional/awareness action” (solely), nor “thought speech” nor maybe whispered speech. These have subtle pitfalls, so it's maybe better to let these be transformed, through and through, by other practices in the whole, wider document.
