(See the Death LARP appendix, too, which currently has a more complete treatment.)

Below are group scenarios or personal thought experiments.

Note: I have literally never participated in a LARP or even a TTRPG. I used to play MTG and online MUDs, though, for what it's worth. At the time of this writing, I haven't tried these yet, so I don't have a good sense of who or when things below might be useful or what the psychological risk-reward-cost ratios are like. The "Pocket Guide to American Freeform" (see below) and many, many other resources may have suggestions for safety and other decision criteria. Maybe especially read a discussion of the idea of "bleed," and possibly lots of other things!

The general use case for these is that poor health is generally "tucked away" in modern society, until a friend, family member, or yourself gets really sick or suffers other misfortune. [...]
