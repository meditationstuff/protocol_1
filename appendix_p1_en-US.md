Non-exhaustive, not entirely systematic, playing with compact argument forms:

Given or assuming A, if [it were the case that] X [had been Y], then [it would have been the case that] Q [would have been R]; but, since, instead, [it was the case that] X [was W], then, Q [was instead S].

Given or assuming A, If [it were the case that] X hadn’t been Y, then [it would have been the case that] Q would have been R; but, since X (in fact, basically, more or less) was Y, then, Q was instead S.

Given or assuming A, If [it were the case that] X hadn’t been Y, then [it would have been the case that] Q wouldn’t/would not have been R; but, since X (in fact, basically, more or less) was Y, then, Q was (in fact, basically, more or less) R.

Given or assuming A, if X were Y (full stop; or, instead of X currently being Z), then Q would have been R; but, instead, since, X wasn’t Y, then Q wasn’t R, and Q is (in fact, basically, more or less) S, instead.

Given or assuming A, If X weren’t Y, then Q would have been R. 

Given or assuming A, if X had been Y, then Q can’t/couldn’t have been R (because M); and, since Q can (could have) only been R or S (not both; nor neither; again given or assuming A), then Q must be (have been) S.

Given or assuming A, if X had been Y, then Q can’t/couldn’t have been R (because M); and, since Q can (could have) only been R or S (not both; nor neither; again given or assuming A), then Q must be (have been) S.

Given or assuming A, if X had been Y, then Q can’t/couldn’t have been R, nor S, (because M); and, since Q can (could have) only been exactly one of R, S, and T (again given or assuming A), then Q must be (have been) T.

Given or assuming A, if it is [the case that] A (and it might not be), then it is (universally, necessarily, must be) [the case that] B.

Given or assuming A, if it is [the case that] A (and it might not be), then it is (generally) [the case that] B, except when [it is the case that] C.

Given or assuming A, If [it is the case that] X [does or did obtain; and it maybe doesn’t or didn’t], then [it is or will be the case that] Q.

Given or assuming A, If [it is the case that] X doesn’t or didn’t obtain, then [it is or will be the case that] Q.

Given or assuming A, if [it is the case that] X, then Q implies R; and, if Q implies R, we can say that, if Q, then R.

Given or assuming A, if [it is the case that] Q implies R, then P.

Given or assuming A, if [it is the case that] Q implies R, then S implies P.

modus ponens, modus tollens

If an A is P, then that A is Q.
