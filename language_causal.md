Possibility cloud  
The gap between stimulus and response  
What else might be going on  
What else might be happening here  
Dwelling in that  
Counterfactual repertoire…  
Alternative explanations  
Noticing anomalies huh that’s funny  
Where other else might be  
Safety and non-habit in order to dwell there  
Where the world hasn’t yet been reconstructed  
“The causal” maybe  
Ironically very frustrated and triggered by people who aren’t…  
Interpretations of listy scenes with red herrings…  
Max out possibilities for parallelism, parallel structure… actually something to talk 
about  

For all sentence types or something… cf. X main sentence types idk…

Ey was or appeared \[to be] or seemed \[to be]… 

* Or perhaps ey was maybe…
* Or perhaps ey was maybe…

\[what was the double thing…]

These are perspectives? Views? Alternative explanations? Alternative ontologies and descriptions!

\[\[\[\[Maybe perhaps possibly probably]]]]]

* Perhaps maybe could have been
* Perhaps maybe would have been
* Perhaps maybe might have been

cf. likelihood…

… a dog or a rabbit…

Might have shifted in eir seat, or maybe ey was…

The hallway (or was it a corridor) was dark or it was dreary or it was luminescently lit or it was all of the above…

Productive ambiguous and multiple plausible interpretations or…

the reversible; the uncommitted, the not-overcomitted, the "well, maybe"

Perhaps there, or elsewhere, or nowhere \[there] was or wasn’t a maybe-it or maybe-"its" or no one or nothing at all. 

something or someone or nothing it-ish, or it-like, or it-esque, or maybe-it, or almost-it, or not-exactly-it or nothing or no one at all. 

And in or around or on that place (or elsewhere or nowhere or with respect to nothing place-like) or all of these or some of these or none at all

Perhaps nothing happened at all, or: …
… or perhaps nothing happened at all or something else \[happened]. 

One or the other or perhaps both, or something else, \[or all possibilities], or none or neither or something else and else yet again

Perhaps maybe some might call it a… but others might call it a…

Maybe anything else or everything else or nothing at all or not even that

Maybe here or there or elsewhere or anywhere or nowhere or somewhere 

X makes sense or exists; X doesn’t make sense or exist or is meaningful, etc. 

X and not X, depending on…

So maybe X or maybe not X. Perhaps X if Y; Perhaps not X if ? (Z? Not Y? Question the if??

nothing, nothings, and nothingness

* The first thing
* The second thing 
* The first relation(ship)

* It 
* The whole thing
* Everything about it
* This non-thing-like thing; cf. “this process”
* This vague thing
* This nebulous barely-thing thing
* This nebulous barely-thing-like thing. 
* This barely-existing[-as-such] barely-even-the-possibility-of-a-thing thing.
* This non-thing-that-we’re-treating-as-thing thing.


This barely-there-there-and-gone-whisp[er]-of-feeling feeling. (Apparently feelings are not things.)

This non-relation(ship) relation(ship); this relation(ship) that’s a particular type of absence of a relation(ship).

chair-oid, chair-esque, evidently having the function of a chair, vaguely-chair-like, chair-like, ambiguously chair-ish,  

The thing was recognizable and recognizably itself. 

It was not a person and not-not a person. 

The thing that is intended (by e.g. you and me) to directly represent this other thing. 

The non-thing-like thing was not-[exactly-]walking in the not-really-a-place. 

* The place
* The location
* The barely-thing barely-existed in the barely-place.

(These things are the same thing.)

cf. something
De dicto / de re / de se

\*

Continuing to go up in abstraction until get like “event” (vs e.g. conference which as all wrong connotations). “Event was too generic to describe it”… <— but also need character to have a reason to be thinking this..

\*

* These mean the same thing in fewer and more words
* ?summarizing for who? The main ideas as it were for whom? The crucial details for whom?
* cf. compare with Wittgenstein philosophical investigations and enaction wikipedia

\*

cf . versus etc

A type of Intension..
How to find, point out, create, summon, demonstrate, instantiate, or exemplify the extension 


* That which directly represents…
* This stands for…
* This signifies…
* This means…
* Instruction vs representation…
